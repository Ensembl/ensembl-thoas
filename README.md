# GraphQL for Ensembl

A [GraphQL trial](https://graphql.org/) for [Ensembl](https://www.ensembl.org) to reduce the need for RESTful web services.

This application is implemented with [Ariadne](https://ariadnegraphql.org/), a schema-first graphql framework for Python

/scripts contains tooling for populating backend databases

GraphQL requires a schema (in /common) and implementation of resolver functions that know how to interpret specific parts of a GraphQL query. Resolvers are found in /resolver, and may also make use of "data loaders" to overcome inherent deficiencies in GraphQL implementations.

## Installation

Set up Python 3
pip install -r /requirements.txt

## Running the service directly
uvicorn metadata_service.server:app

## Testing



## Containerisation
